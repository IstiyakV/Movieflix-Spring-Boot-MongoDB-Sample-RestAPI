- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing movie data efficiently in a flexible JSON-like format.
- **ReactJS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for dynamic and interactive frontend experiences.

## Features

- **RESTful API:** Exposes endpoints for CRUD operations on movie data, enabling seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented to ensure data privacy and access control.
- **Dynamic Frontend:** Utilizes ReactJS to create an intuitive and responsive user interface for browsing, searching, and interacting with movie content.
- **Data Persistence:** Leveraging MongoDB for scalable and efficient storage of movie information, supporting seamless retrieval and modification operations.
